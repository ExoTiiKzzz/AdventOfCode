# Advent of code 2023

## Why?

I am now a developer for 3 years and I have never done any advent of code. I have heard about it but never tried it.
This year, we decided with friends to do it together and share our solutions daily.

This is the first time I am participating in this kind of event, so I am not sure how it will go. I will try my best and
will be grateful for any feedback ðŸ˜Š.

For the beginning, I will do it in python, but I planned to start to learn rust, so I will probably switch to rust in
the end.

## Day 1

### [Part 1](./1/part1.py)

Find digits in strings and sum first and last digit of each row. Add the sum to the total.

### [Part 2](./1/part2.py)

Find digits in strings and sum first and last digit of each row, but this time the digits can be in letters. Add the sum
to the total.

## Day 2

### [Part 1](./2/part1.py)

Given a number of red, green and blue cubes, check for each game if the numbers of cubes given are possible. If so, add
the game id to the total.

### [Part 2](./2/part2.py)

Given a number of red, green and blue cubes, give the minimum number of cubes that are needed for each game to be
possible. Multiply them for each row and sum them up.
